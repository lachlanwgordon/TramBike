"""
Predefined graphs for testing and experimentation.

* Graphs are defined via lists containing tuples
* Each tuple in the list represents an edge
* Edges are defined as (start, end, length)

For example, an equilateral triangle like:

   1
  / \
 2 - 3

Would be represented as:

triangle = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1 ,1)]
